# Km Nuke Backup And Recovery

Notice : current version support Nuke 12 and older , But not Nuke 13 . I will update it for support nuke 13 ASAP I can ! 

## What is Km Backup And Recovery Toolkit ?
It’s a tool(script) for Nuke that every time user saves the project, create backups from project file in one or two different locations.

.

## Why should I use this ?
Sometimes Nuke project files are corrupted and there’s no way to get it back. For example, project file won’t open or nodes connections are gone. So Km Backup And Recovery Toolkit makes backups from project hourly or daily and whenever we have problem, we can use backups files.
